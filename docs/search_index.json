However, the advantages that one could enjoy in this city are not free. According to the study of The Economist, NYC is the 7th most expensive city in 2020. One of the major parts contributing to this ranking is the extremely high real estate price. We hope that in our study, by performing data visualization on NYCs property sales records in the past 12 months, we could get a better and more in-depth understanding of the trend of the property sales market in NYC. Specifically, we focus on how geographical features, sold date, and property size and type affect the prices. Furthermore, due to the pandemic, 2020 become an incredibly different and hard year for New York, one of the earliest major U.S. cities shut down due to COVID-19. Therefore, we will also look into how COVID-19 influenced the property market in NYC. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources The project is mainly based on a data set about sales data of properties in New York City that sold from 2019-11-01 to 2020-10-31, named Rolling Sales data. The data is collected and provided by the NYC Department of Finance. See nyc.gov website. The data set has over 35 thousand records, and each record includes the following variables: Borough (factor): The name of the borough in which the property is located Neighborhood (factor): The name of the neighborhood in which the property is located Zip Code (numeric): The propertys postal code Building Class Category (factor): A descriptive category about the usage of the property Building Class at Present (char): The building code of the property at present, which is used to describe the propertys constructive use Building Class at Time of Sale (char): The building code of the property at time of sale Tax Class at Present (char): The tax class of the property at present Tax Class at Time of Sale (char): The tax class of the property at time of sale Residential Units (numeric): The number of residential units at the property Commercial Units (numeric): The number of commercial units at the property Total Units (numeric): The total number of units at the property Land Square Feet (numeric): The land area of the property in square feet Gross Square Feet (numeric): The total area of all the floors of a building in square feet. Year Built (numeric): Year the structure on the property was built Sales Price (numeric): Price paid for the property Sale Date (date): Date the property sold Here we only list the variables we have used in our project. For a complete list of variables, please refer to the glossary document of the data. See nyc.gov website. For the most part, the data set is complete. However, one problem with the data is that some properties do not have available data of gross square feet, while others do not have available data of land square feet, which caused some difficulty when we were choosing a denominator to calculate the unit price of properties. Another problem is that the data records all transfers of property ownership, including those without a cash consideration, like a transfer of ownership from parents to children. These cases usually have $0 or very low sales prices. How we should set up a threshold to exclude these cases became a question. In the next section, we will discuss the way we handle these problems. Besides the major data set, two other data sets were partly involved in section 5.2. The first one is the NYC Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Data provided by the NYC Health Department. See this GitHub repo. We used this data for the daily Covid-19 count in NYC in 2020. The other data set is the sales record of properties in NYC from 2019-01-01 to 2019-12-31, which has the exact same format as the major data set, and is also collected by the Department of Finance. See nyc.gov website. For map visualization, we used data of zip code boundaries of NYC, which is provided by the Department of Information Technology &amp; Telecommunications (DoITT). See NYC Open Data. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation For the Rolling Sales data (sales data of properties in New York City that sold from 2019-11-01 to 2020-10-31), we manually engineered features on the basis of the existing features as below to accommodate the research questions of this study. Given the tax class and building class of a property at the time of sale and present, we introduced two new variables to indicate whether the tax class or building class has changed since sales. Given the year built for each property, we created a feature, history, for each property. The feature is calculated as the year the property was sold minus the year the property was built. Compared to the sales price of a property, unit price (price per square foot) is a more objective reflection of a propertys price level as it is not influenced by the area of a property. Therefore, we define unit price of a property as the sales price divided by the gross square feet of the property (which is an industry convention), and when gross square feet is 0, we substitute it with the land square feet. Within the property sales data set, which contains 35873 records, there are 15178 sales records with sales price 0. Such transactions indicate the transfer of ownership without a cash consideration. They are not included in the study since our interest lies in the commercial aspect of the property sales market. Furthermore, we extended the idea to those records with abnormal low sales prices. Although those transactions do involve a cash flow, they do not indicate typical commercial property tradings and should also be excluded. Therefore, we decided to set a threshold and ignore all records with a sales price lower than that. The distribution of the sales price after excluding all transactions with price 0 is shown in the following figure. We use log scale in the x-axis to eliminate the long tail caused by several records with extremely high sales, so that the distribution of most records could be seen clearer. We observe that the distribution displayed on a log scale is strongly left-skewed; most of the transactions have a sales price higher than one million dollars. While the minimum sales price is below ten dollars, and the maximum is close to a billion. Eventually, we decided to exclude records with a sales price below 10,000. By such an exclusion, we reduced a large amount of skewness of the data as the number of figures of the sales price from the rest of the records are approximately symmetric with a mean of seven figures. Hence, 10,000 seems like a reasonable threshold. Specifically, beyond the 15,178 records with sales price 0, there are 838 sales records with a sales price between 1(inclusive) and 10,000. We regarded those 16016 records as unhelpful transactions and ignored them in our further analysis. We preprocessed the property sales data for 2019 in the same fashion as we processed our Rolling sales data. However, although we have full-year sales data for 2019, we only included records from 2019-03-01 to 2019-10-31 for comparison purposes. We hoped to compare to the same period in 2020 and learn how COVID-19 might have influenced NYCs property sales market. Recall that COVID-19 related data for NYC are available starting from 2020-02-29, and the rolling sales data only contains records until 2020-10-31. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values There is no missing value after our preprocessing of the data. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results", " Chapter 5 Results Section 5.1. Property sales evolution and distribution in NYC We first take a look at the property sales by borough. In the upper left plot in figure 2, we observe that Queens and Brooklyn have the highest property sales in the past 12 months, while Manhattan is the borough with significantly lower property sales. However, in terms of total sales amount (accumulated sale prices in each borough), Manhattan reaches the highest amount of total sales with the least sales count. Although Queens has a higher sales count than Brooklyn, it has less total sales amount (upper right in figure 2). While we inspect the unit price, which is the price per square feet of each property, Manhattan has the highest median unit price in all five boroughs, and Brooklyn has a higher median unit price than Queens. This observation is consistent with our inspection of the upper two plots. Also, we noticed that the Bronx has the lowest median unit price among all 5 boroughs. Next, we inspect the time series for the sale amount, total sale, and median unit sale price in the past year for each borough separately. From the daily sales amount, we observe that the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island share a similar trend, while Brooklyn and Queens are almost identical in their magnitudes of each days sales. For Manhattan, the general sales amount is low, but there are three peaks, one in January, one in March, and one in November. Moving forward to the time series of daily sales amount, we observe that the sales amount per day is consistent with several peaks for all boroughs. For median unit price per day, we notice that Manhattan has higher statistics than other boroughs, which matches with the intuition. Then, we use a Cleveland dot plot to visualize the top 20 most popular neighborhoods in terms of sales count, and the top 20 most expensive neighborhoods in terms of the median unit price. From the first plot, we observe the neighborhoods from Queens and Brooklyn dominate the top 20 most popular ones, with two exceptions of Great Kills from Staten Island at 4th place and Baychester from the Bronx at 16th place. In the ranking of the most expensive neighborhoods, neighborhoods from Manhattan and Brooklyn share all top 20. In this part, we look deeper into the statistics and categorize the median unit price by the building categories of the properties. Note that here we use log scale here to generate a clearer exhibition of the price difference in the middle price range. An interesting observation is that for the family dwellings, one is the most expensive, two is less, and three is the least expensive. This trend holds for all boroughs in NYC. Furthermore, while family dwellings in Queens, the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Staten are similar in price, the same type of property in Manhattan is much higher than the other neighborhoods. We also noticed that they all are in the same descending order in terms of median unit price: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten, and the Bronx at last. When we look at the percentage of properties that has the tax or building class changed after sales, we observe from the left plot that around 10% of properties experienced tax class change after sales and few of them experienced building class change. Then we draw a box plot of the sales price distribution, and grouped it by whether or not the properties experienced class change to see if the sales price of the properties in one group is different from those in the other. The first plot on the right is the original box plot. We notice that the group with tax class change do not have as many outliers as the group without tax class changs. And among its outliers, no one has extremely high sales price. The observation may be resulted from the difference between sample size, or from other reasons that are not clear yet. Due to the long tail consisting of outliers, we can barely see the inter-quartile range. Therefore, we zoom in the original plot in the second box plot, and find that compared to properties without tax class change, those with tax class change usually have higher sales prices. Then we try to figure out how the rest continuous variables, such as number of units, area, and history of a property, impact the sales price, so we use a scatter plot matrix colored by borough to find the correlations. The result shows that both the number of units and history of a property have no correlation with the sales price, so we omit them from figure 7. On the other hand, the sales price shows correlation with the square feet, but only in several boroughs. In Queens and Staten, both the gross square feet and the land square feet are positively correlated to the sales price. In Brooklyn, only the land square feet is positively correlated to the sales price. The observation is actually pretty counter-intuitive, since we generally believe that sales price should be proportional to the square feet. The reason behind the low correlation values between the sales price and the square feet for other boroughs might be the vast difference in unit price between neighborhoods in the same borough. Recall that when we research the top 20 most expensive neighborhoods, there is a huge difference in unit price between those neighborhoods, and most of them are from Manhattan or Brooklyn. On the other hand, while the Bronx does not have expensive neighborhoods, it has the lowest median unit price among all boroughs and the cheapest family dwellings. Therefore, most properties sales price in the area may be generally low regardless of the square feet. Section 5.2. COVID-19 and property sales in NYC We observe that both the sales count and the sales amount of 2020 are in general lower compared to those of the year 2019, although both of them start off higher in 2020 when the COVID-19 barely began to spread in NYC (shown in figure 8(a)). As COVID-19 cases surge from the middle of March, we observe an evident decrease in both sales count and sales amount. Although later trends are not as obvious as the sudden drop in mid-March, the sales count display an opposite trend compared to the trend of the COVID-19 cases. Such an association is also observed with the sales amount but even less obvious. From figure 8(b), we observe that most days have fewer than 1,000 COVID-19 cases. To be more specific, 147 out of the 203 days in the record have lower or equal to 1,000 COVID-19 cases. Most days with relatively fewer COVID-19 cases (below 1,000) have between 50 to 100 cases of property sales. The sales count dots for days with relatively fewer COVID-19 cases are more widely spread on the sales count axis. Also, we observe a weak negative association between the daily COVID-19 case count and daily sales count as the days with more cases tend to have lower property transaction counts. In terms of sales amount, it is quite stable across days with different COVID-19 case counts. However, we notice that several days with relatively fewer COVID-19 cases have extremely high total sales amount, which does not happen during days with much more cases. A Pearson correlation test suggests a statistically significant negative correlation(-0.15) between COVID-19 case count and property sales count (p-value of 0.03&lt;0.05). However, the correlation between the COVID-19 case count and the sales amount is not statistically significant, according to the Pearson correlation test. Such findings corroborate our observations in the times series plot. Figure 9(a) shows the COVID-19 case rate per 100,000 people and the property sales by record where the top 10 zip codes are highlighted. The zip codes with the top 10 highest sales counts are located in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. And in general, these zip codes are on the side of their boroughs that are further from Manhattan. Indeed, we can observe a pattern that the zip codes further from Manhattan generally have higher sales count. The zip codes with a high median unit sales price are mostly located in Manhattan, with the exception of 11249 in Brooklyn and 10034 in the Bronx. The zip code with the highest median unit sales price is 10105 in Manhattan; its median unit price is 8915.551 USD per square foot, while all other zip codes have a median unit price below 2,000 USD per square foot. In fact, there is only one transaction of the commercial vacant land in 10105, which has an extremely high unit price. On the other hand, the fact that 10034 in the Bronx being the third most expensive zip code is quite surprising, considering our previous findings. A closer examination of the zip code shows that there are only four property transactions in 10034, and two of them (the transactions of a commercial garage and a religious facility) have very high unit prices and thus drive up the median unit price. As for sales amount, zip codes with a high sales amount can be divided into two groups. The first group is mostly price-driven, such as 10017 and 10018 in Manhattan. Typically, properties in these zip codes tend to have high unit prices but low sales count. The second group is quantity driven, such as 11234 and 11236 in Queens; these zip codes have lower unit prices but fairly large sales count. Figure 9(b) presents a clearer display of the association between COVID-19 case rate and property sales by zip code. According to Figure 9(b), most zip codes have COVID-19 case rates between 2,000 to 6,000 (out of 100,000). Also, we observe a positive association between the COVID-19 case rate and the property sales count in the scatter plot of Figure 9(b). According to the Pearson correlation test, the COVID-19 case rate of a zip code is positively associated with the sales count within that zip code; the correlation between the two is 0.5021585. Such association is statistically significant (p-value &lt; 2.2e-16). On the other hand, the Pearson correlation test suggests a statistically significant mild negative association (correlation -0.43 and p-value 8.392e-10) between COVID-19 case rate and median unit price; such a negative association can also be observed from the scatter plot. The correlation between COVID-19 case rate and sales amount is not statistically significant. In a word, zip codes with higher COVID-19 case rates tend to have higher sales count but lower median unit sales price. Such a pattern, related to the real-world situation, might indicate an area with weaker economic performance. However, it is too early to draw any conclusion like that during the phase of exploratory analysis, and further study is required. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component When producing figure 9(a) in the previous section, we noticed the difficulty in recognizing the position of the neighborhood a zip code refers to. Therefore, we re-draw the map as an interactive component in this chapter. By hovering over each district on the map, you can see its corresponding zip code, sales count, median unit price, and total sales in the past year. We hope that when readers are viewing the result and conclusion of the project, this map could provide an overall picture of the data and serve as a helpful reference. Ideally, the map should also have multiple coloring options (by sales count/total sales/), but we could not realize such a feature. The current map is colored by the median unit price of each zip code. #map { height: 580px; margin: 0 auto; position: relative; max-width: 1400px; } .info { padding: 6px 8px; font: 14px/16px Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; background: white; background: rgba(255,255,255,0.8); box-shadow: 0 0 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); border-radius: 5px; } .legend { text-align: left; line-height: 18px; color: #555; } .legend i { width: 18px; height: 18px; float: left; margin-right: 8px; opacity: 0.7; } "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion To begin with, the impact of geographical features to the sales price is considerable. In general, Manhattan has the least number of property sales in 2020, with low sale amount throughout the entire year except few days. In the meantime, Manhattan has the highest unit price: 11 out of top 20 most expensive neighborhoods are in Manhattan. Therefore, Manhattan reached the highest cumulative sale amount with lowest number of sales. The generally higher housing price in Manhattan can also be shown in the perspective of housing type categories, where the family dwelling in Manhattan has much higher median unit price than any other boroughs. For Brooklyn and Queens, their sales count is much higher than Manhattan. 18 out of the top 20 most popular neighborhood are in these two boroughs. However, the unit price in Brooklyn is relatively higher than that in Queens, and Brooklyn has some of the most expensive neighborhoods. In the Bronx, both the sales count and the median unit price are lower than those in other boroughs. Speaking of the relationship between the sales price and the property area, the sales price is positively correlated to square feet of the property in Queens and Staten Island. But such positive correlation is not observed or not significant in other boroughs. Besides, properties with tax class change after sales tend to have higher sales price than those without change, but seldom have sales price greater than 100 million dollars. In terms of the relationship between COVID-19 and the property sales market in NYC, compared to the the property sales of the same period in 2019, we observe a drop in both sales count and sales amount. A significant negative association was discovered between daily COVID-19 cases and daily sales count. Furthermore, zip codes with higher COVID-19 case rates tend to have higher sales count but lower median unit sales price; however, future work are still needed to explore the reasons behind such association.
